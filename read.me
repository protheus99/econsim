## 🎮 How to Use

### Controls

- **▶ Play**: Resume simulation
- **⏸ Pause**: Pause simulation
- **Speed Controls**: Adjust simulation speed (0.5x, 1x, 2x)

### Interface Sections

1. **Global Economy**: Total population, GDP, employment statistics
2. **Top Corporations**: Revenue and profit rankings
3. **Market Activity**: Real-time transaction volume
4. **World Map**: Interactive city map with infrastructure indicators
5. **Cities**: Detailed city information and demographics
6. **Active Products**: Product prices, demand, and supply
7. **Transportation Calculator**: Calculate shipping costs between cities
8. **Event Feed**: Live updates on economic events

### Transportation Calculator

1. Select origin and destination cities
2. Enter number of cargo units
3. Choose priority (Cost, Speed, Reliability, or Balanced)
4. Click "Calculate Route"
5. View all available options with costs and transit times

### Interactive Map

- Click on cities to select them
- Click two cities to view the route between them
- City colors indicate infrastructure:
  - Green: Standard city
  - Blue: Coastal city with seaport

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Systems

#### GameClock
- Manages game time (1 real second = 1 game hour)
- Emits events for hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly updates
- Handles pause/resume and speed controls

#### City
- Economic class distribution (6 classes)
- Demographics calculation (working age, employed, unemployed)
- Purchasing power computation
- Infrastructure tracking (airport, seaport, railway)

#### CityManager
- Manages all cities in the simulation
- Handles city generation and updates
- Calculates distances and shipping costs

#### TransportationNetwork
- 5 transport types with realistic costs
- Distance-based cost calculation
- Infrastructure requirements
- Transit time computation

#### SimulationEngine
- Coordinates all systems
- Processes hourly, daily, monthly, yearly updates
- Manages corporations and products
- Tracks market history and events

### UI Components

#### Dashboard
- Updates all interface elements
- Handles user interactions
- Manages control buttons
- Populates data displays

#### MapRenderer
- Renders interactive city map
- Handles city selection
- Draws transportation routes
- Updates in real-time

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `data/config.json` to customize:

- Starting year
- Number of initial cities
- Population ranges
- Economic class distributions
- Transportation costs and speeds
- Product categories
- Corporation settings

## 🔧 Development

### Adding New Features

1. **New City Feature**:
   - Modify `js/core/City.js`
   - Update city generation in `CityManager.js`

2. **New Transportation Type**:
   - Add to `transportTypes` in `TransportationNetwork.js`
   - Update UI in `Dashboard.js`

3. **New Product**:
   - Add to `generateProducts()` in `SimulationEngine.js`
   - Update `data/config.json`

### Debug Console

Open browser console and use:
```javascript
// Get simulation state
debug.getState()

// Access cities
debug.getCities()

// Access corporations
debug.getCorporations()

// Control simulation
debug.pause()
debug.resume()
debug.setSpeed(2)

// Add custom event
debug.addEvent('info', 'Test', 'Custom event message')
```

## 📊 Economic Model

### City Demographics

- **Non-Working**: 30% (children, retired, etc.)
- **Working Age**: 70% of population
- **Employment Rate**: 85% of working age
- **Unemployment**: 15% of working age

### Economic Classes

| Class | Population | Salary Range | Disposable Income |
|-------|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Lower | 25% | $20K - $35K | 15% |
| Working | 35% | $35K - $55K | 25% |
| Lower Middle | 25% | $55K - $110K | 35% |
| Upper Middle | 14% | $110K - $375K | 45% |
| Upper | 1% | $375K - $1.5M | 55% |
| Rich | 0.05% | $1.5M - $5M | 65% |

### Salary Calculation
```
Average Salary = Min + (Max - Min) × City Salary Level
```

Where City Salary Level ranges from 0.1 to 1.0

## 🚚 Transportation Costs

| Type | Cost/km | Speed | Min Distance | Infrastructure |
|------|---------|-------|--------------|----------------|
| Local Road | $0.50 | 50 km/h | 0 km | None |
| Highway | $0.30 | 90 km/h | 50 km | None |
| Train | $0.15 | 80 km/h | 100 km | Railway |
| Air | $2.50 | 600 km/h | 200 km | Airport |
| Sea | $0.08 | 40 km/h | 500 km | Seaport |

*Note: Air and Sea freight include base costs ($500 and $1000 respectively)*

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Simulation not starting
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure you're using a local web server (not file://)
- Verify all JavaScript files are loading

### Blank map
- Check browser width (minimum 1024px recommended)
- Verify cities are generated (check console)
- Try refreshing the page

### Performance issues
- Reduce simulation speed
- Close other browser tabs
- Use a modern browser
